- make sure all parts have all fermatas; turn of hide empty staves to do this
- get tempo staff working and put it in multiple places (also, why is that one rit not displaying?)
- Center systems vertically better?
- Fix dynamic text so that it's actually interpreted as dynamics, then remove all that padding
- Instrumentation page. Fix the one I have to say sleigh bells
